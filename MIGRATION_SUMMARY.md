# Migration Summary: Task Service from Python/Celery to Go

This document summarizes the changes made to migrate the task service from Python/Celery to Go while keeping the LLM processing in Python.

## Overview

The migration involved:
1. Creating a Go-based task service to replace the Python/Celery implementation
2. Keeping the Python LLM service for model interactions
3. Updating the task creation endpoint to call the Go service
4. Updating Docker configuration to include the new services

## Files Created

### Go Service Files
- `services/tasks/main.go` - Main HTTP service for task management
- `services/tasks/simple_worker.go` - Background worker that processes tasks
- `services/tasks/Dockerfile` - Docker configuration for the Go service
- `services/tasks/README.md` - Documentation for the Go service
- `services/tasks/go.mod` - Go module definition

### Python API Endpoint
- `app/api/endpoints/llm.py` - New endpoint for the Go service to call LLM functionality

## Files Modified

### Main Application
- `app/main.py` - Added import and registration of the new LLM endpoint
- `app/api/endpoints/tasks.py` - Updated to call the Go service instead of Celery
- `app/api/endpoints/__init__.py` - Added import for the new LLM endpoint

### Docker Configuration
- `docker-compose.yml` - Added task-service and task-worker containers

### Documentation
- `README.md` - Updated architecture diagram and project structure

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Python/Celery)
```
Client ↔ Web Server (FastAPI) ↔ Database (PostgreSQL)
              ↓
      Task Queue (Celery) ↔ Redis (Broker/Cache)
              ↓
       LLM Services (Ollama etc.)
```

### After (Go Service)
```
Client ↔ Web Server (FastAPI) ↔ Database (PostgreSQL)
              ↓
      Task Service (Go)
              ↓
      Task Worker (Go)
              ↓
     LLM Services (Python)
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Go Task Service
- Simplified HTTP server using Go's standard library
- Task creation and status endpoints
- Designed to be extended with database and queue integration

### Go Task Worker
- Background process that processes tasks
- Calls the Python LLM service via HTTP
- Designed to be extended with queue integration

### Python LLM Endpoint
- New REST endpoint for the Go service to call LLM functionality
- Maintains the same interface as the previous direct LLM service calls

### Task Creation Flow
1. Client sends task creation request to Python web server
2. Python web server stores task in database
3. Python web server calls Go task service to process the task
4. Go task service queues the task for processing
5. Go task worker processes the task by calling the Python LLM endpoint
6. Results are stored in the database

## Benefits of the Migration

1. **Language Separation**: Task orchestration in Go, LLM processing in Python
2. **Performance**: Go's concurrency model for task processing
3. **Scalability**: Independent scaling of task service and LLM service
4. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
5. **Flexibility**: Easier to extend and modify the task processing logic

## Next Steps

1. Implement database integration in the Go service
2. Implement proper task queue mechanism (Redis, RabbitMQ, etc.)
3. Add task status updates from worker to database
4. Implement error handling and retry mechanisms
5. Add monitoring and logging
6. Implement task prioritization
7. Add support for task cancellation

## Deployment

The new services are configured in docker-compose.yml:
- `task-service`: Main API service running on port 8081
- `task-worker`: Background worker process

To deploy:
```bash
docker-compose build task-service task-worker
docker-compose up task-service task-worker
```
